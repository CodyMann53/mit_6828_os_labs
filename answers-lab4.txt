1. mpentry.S is loaded at MPENTRY_PADDR instead of x100000 which is where boot.S is loaded
at when the bootloader loads the kernel. This requires that the mpentry.S reference symbols 
in its binary as an offset from the MPENTRY_PADDR load address instead of the the link address
of the kernel code. This is only needed until paging is turned on for the AP, in which case
the symbols in mpentry.S will work correctly due to being linked with the same link addresses
as the kernel code.
